sshlpr2

INTRODUCTION

When your printer is connected to your SSH server, but not to you, you can
use sshlpr2 to create a CUPS printer that behaves like a remote server.

Similar work was done by Andre Masella. His original sshlpr script can be
found at

http://www.masella.name/technical/sshlpr.html

The original version of sshlpr has two problems:

(1) Requires your SSH server to accept public key authentication. Password
authentication will certainly fail, because when ssh is run by CUPS it
is not able to open a terminal.

(2) Requires CUPS to run su, which will also fail because CUPS is not
connected to a terminal.

To avoid the su problems, sshlpr2 has a simple server daemon that accepts
jobs submitted to it (via the sshlpr backend) and forwards the jobs to
clients attached to it (via sshlpr_client).

sshlpr_client can be run in an X environment, so that you can launch xterm
and key in your password. sshlpr_client is setuid lp, in order to allow you
to connect to sshlprd.

INSTALLATION

On a regular Ubuntu system, type:

$ ./configure; make; sudo make install

If you are on other Linux/Mac system, have a look at the configure options
specific to sshlpr2:

  --with-cups-backend     CUPS backend directory, e.g. /usr/lib/cups/backend
  --with-socket-dir       Socket directory, e.g. /var/sshlpr
  --with-lpuser           Username to setuid the CUPS backend and client

HOW IT WORKS

0. Initialization
	a) sshlprd is running.
	b) Some user runs sshlpr_client, which connects to sshlprd

1. sshlpr
	a) Creates a FIFO in /tmp
	b) Submits job request to sshlprd

2. sshlpr_client
	a) Receives the job request from sshlprd
	b) Executes sshlpr_helper, passing parameters from the job request
		to sshlpr_helper

3. sshlpr_helper
	a) Reads the parameters
	b) Starts an xterm process that:
		i]   Reads from the FIFO, and pipes the output to...
		ii]  ... an ssh process that runs the ...
		iii] ... lpr process on the remote end

HOW TO USE IT

After installation, create a printer based on the sshlpr2 backend on

sshlpr://abc123@linux.pwf.cam.ac.uk/Pem_CC_1_BW

Unlike the original sshlpr, the local user does not have to be specified,
because you will always execute ssh as the user that created the print job.
